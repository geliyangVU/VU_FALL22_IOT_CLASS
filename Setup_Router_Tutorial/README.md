#Setup Router Tutorial

##Turn to the back of the router package
I found the SSID on the back of the router in my case: It is GL-MT300N-V2-7fe
First of all, I power the router with a power cord. The left more light started flashing.
Then I search for the SSID I found on the back of the router page: GL-MT300N-V2-7fe.

##Enter the url for admin panel
Then I entered admin page url "192.168.8.1" into the chrome browser.
